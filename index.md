[An Introduction to Audio Content Analysis](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?bknumber=6266785) introduces standard base-line approaches to a variety of audio analysis and music information retrieval tasks and provides the reader with a multitude of pointers and references if interested. The book itself is accompanied by a range of free [resources](#resources) for learning, teaching, and developing audio analysis systems. 

The second edition of the book is restructured, modernized, and expanded.

Targeting engineers, graduate students, and programmers with basic knowledge of signal processing, the book describes various analysis algorithms with their theoretical, technical, musical and perceptual background. "An Introduction to Audio Content Analysis) covers topics including low level feature extraction, fundamental frequency detection, key and chord recognition, onset and tempo detection, as well as tasks such as alignment and genre classification.
