## data-sets

This is yet another attempt of maintaining a list of datasets directly related to MIR. Other lists that I have found are the [ISMIR page](http://www.ismir.net/resources/datasets/), [this web page](http://grh.mur.at/sites/default/files/mir_datasets_0.html), and [this web page](http://colinraffel.com/wiki/mir_datasets). If you are interested in speech processing, you can find a table of speech datasets on [this page](https://wiki.inria.fr/rosp/Datasets#Speech_datasets). If you are interested in multi-tracks, the [Open Multitrack Testbed](http://multitrack.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) should be a good starting point. UPF also has an excellent page with [datasets for world-music](http://compmusic.upf.edu/datasets), including Indian art music, Turkish Makam music, and Beijing Opera. A curated list of MIDI sources can be found [here](https://github.com/albertmeronyo/awesome-midi-sources0. Two additional general resources are [piano-midi.de](http://www.piano-midi.de/) for MIDI files and [freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org/) for audio files.

If you know of other data sets that should be included in this list please create an [issue/pull request](https://github.com/alexanderlerch/audiocontentanalysis.org/issues) or just [send me a note](mailto:info@audiocontentanalysis.org).
